## Aakash Saxena

Currently, I am working as a Senior AI Engineer at EVS Pvt. Ltd. Here, I develop and enhance AI features for the GenAI team, test them across multiple environments, and release them to production. My work includes end-to-end delivery of models and tooling that power generative AI applications.

Earlier, I worked as an NLP Software Engineer at D.A.T.A., Inc., since January 2022 until July 2024. I was involved in R&D to operationalize deception detection concepts using NLP. I also applied NLP tools and techniques for enhancing product experience. 

In August 2020, I completed my doctoral program in Information Analytics from the University of Colorado Boulder. I was mentored and advised by Prof. Jintae Lee.

For my [Ph.D. dissertation](https://search.proquest.com/openview/4befd1d62e7d29a2f4149a816720beea/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=44156), I have developed a semi-supervised method that defines concepts as word sets, contextualizes a text corpus based on a context using corpus refinement, creates a word embedding space from the refined corpus, and extracts context-sensitive semantics of concepts from the word-embedding space. Such a method can assist in capturing real-world perceptions embedded in natural language. Through my dissertation, I showcased one of its many applications by capturing perceptions associated with gender and social roles. If you would like to know more about my Ph.D. research project or about related research topics, please connect with me at aakash.s.07@outlook.com.

I like developing/exploring machines to better understand nuances of our language. As we are diving deeper into the Generative AI era, I am getting more curious about LLMs' capability of encoding context-sensitive semantics of concepts, Technical AI safety, and deploying responsible AI strategies. 

I have worked on the following projects earlier.

- _[How to capture authors' linguistic style? - participated in a kaggle competition](https://nbviewer.org/github/aakashs07/nlp_projects/blob/master/kaggle_spooky_author_identification.ipynb)_
- _[A sneak peek into error analysis of Naïve Bayes algorithm](https://nbviewer.org/github/aakashs07/nlp_projects/blob/master/Twitter_sentiment_analysis_nb1_using_naive_bayes.ipynb)_

### News about my research activities


2024

_December_

- 2nd: Started working at EVS Pvt. Ltd. as Sr. NLP Engineer. This is the next step in my journey to engage in releasing features in production at a larger scale than in my previous role.

_August_

- 14th: Practiced implementing [Trei data structure](https://github.com/aakashs07/nlp_projects/blob/master/trei_ds_prac).

_May_

- 3rd: Internally presented a ML-based deception detection model, identifying features relevant for both deceptiveness and truthfulness.

_February_

- 23rd: Presented "Semantics of darkness: A Text-based analysis" at the final round of the White Paper Competition
  
- 16th: Selected as a top five finalist in the Wharton People Analytics White Paper Competition


2023

_November_

- 8th: One of my ideas "Towards the Semantics of Darkness" got accepted in DeceptiCon 2023 conference for a panel presentation. I am excited about this idea because it deals with using semantic features, extracted from pretrained models with Deep neural architectures like BERT, to categorize dark triad behaviors from the non-dark triad ones.

_March_

- 28th: Prompt engineering demonstration -> Please check out my interaction (as part of D.A.T.A., Inc.) with ChatGPT on deception [here](https://deceptionandtruthanalysis.com/insights/f/chatgpt-and-deception-part-1).

- 17th: I added a few evaluation metrics to my list for evaluating keyphrase extraction task [here](https://aakashs07.github.io/2023/03/17/Evaluation-metrics-for-keyphrase-extraction.html).

- 3rd: I submitted an abstract on "Towards Context-Sensitive Semantics of Linguistic Cues for Deception" in [IC2S2 2023](https://www.ic2s2.org). 


2022

During this year, 
- I worked on a few NLP projects that became part of our company's core products. 
- I worked on NLP tasks such as text classification, document classification, language detection, keyphrase extraction. 
- I became an active participant of Deception Research Society. 


2021

During this year, I worked on revisiting a few concepts of deep learning. I completed a few courses on Coursera. Andrew Ng has been a great resource and has put a lot efforts in democratizing AI. Kudos to him!! 

Please note that I did not update this section of my page as I was busy working on developing a portfolio of NLP projects. Check _[this](https://github.com/aakashs07/nlp_projects/blob/master/Twitter_sentiment_analysis_nb1_using_naive_bayes.ipynb)_ out.  

At Sykes Enterprises, I worked on a few projects that allowed me to apply the knowledge gained through these courses. I worked on exciting NLP projects, such as Keyword Extraction, fine-tune agent-customer call type predictions using BERT, and experiment with AI models for tasks, such as toxicity classification and face detection, using Tensorflow.js.

_December_
- Left Sitel Group. I am grateful to the data science team as this experience provided me an exposure to AI problems faced by a large corporation. I started working on data labelling with the Phillipines team, worked on applying topic modeling to extract topics from customer support interactions, developed and deployed keyword extraction tool on Microsoft Azure. Towards the end of my tenure here, I worked on overseeing data science modeling services for a UK-based major client.

- 10th - Accepted job offer by Deception And Truth Analysis (_[D.A.T.A.](https://deceptionandtruthanalysis.com/)_). This is a role that I have been waiting for. During my Ph.D., I got interested in fake news, misinformation, and deception. I feel grateful and excited to join D.A.T.A. as this role involves me to make societal contribution.

_June_ 
- Sykes Enterprises, Inc. was acquired by Sitel Group.

### News about my hobbies/ recreational experiences


2021

_October_

- 17th: Ran my first 5k! 
My stats for [2021 Colfax 5k](https://www.runcolfax.org/races/race-results/): 
Timing - 26:04 | Overall rank - 76 | Division rank - 14

- 23rd: Registered for my second 5k - [ColderBoulder 5k](https://www.bolderboulder.com/)

- 25th: Started 5k training in my alma mater's recreational center.

- 26th: Viewed this youtube video on breathing - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4WU4ghe7BY. I realize that we need carbon dioxide to reduce the pH of our blood, which then triggers a chemical reaction that detaches oxygen molecules from hemoglobin so that these oxygen molecules can reach different parts of our body. A critical tip in this video is that we should take deep breaths at regular intervals to balance the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide in our system. An imbalance in the amounts of oxygen and carbon dioxide during our run can cause fatigue, dizziness, etc.

- 29th: Achieved my best time of 25 minutes and 50 seconds for 5k.

_November_
